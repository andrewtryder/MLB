Supybot-MLB
===========

*** NOTE ***

THIS PLUGIN IS LOOKING FOR A NEW MAINTAINER AND OWNER. FIND ME ON IRC IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO TAKE OVER OWNERSHIP.

************

Supybot plugin for displaying some baseball/MLB things.

This is kinda a personal plugin that grew into something bigger.

No formal README here. This plugin should work fine on an up-to-date Limnoria on a Python 2.7.3+ install.

NOTE: If you're looking for MLB scores, use my Scores plugin.
